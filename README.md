# Covid DataSet Spain
Dataset of covid data in Spain by CCAA, which includes the followings columns:

  -Comunidad: CCAA of Spain
  -Fecha: The date of the value
  -Casos: The total amount of covid cases registered until that date
  -IA14: The cumulative incidence of the last 14 days
  -Fallecidos: The total amount of covid deaths registered until that date
  
The dataset was get from the daily pdf that the Government of Spain generates every day(https://www.mscbs.gob.es/profesionales/saludPublica/ccayes/alertasActual/nCov/documentos/Actualizacion_283_COVID-19.pdf), and some weekends they don't publish any pdf so maybe some date are missing.

The values may be inconsistent (i.e. the amount of deaths goes down) because the updates that the Government of Spain made in the start of the Covid-19 pandemic.
